This is not how GitHub works mostly, GitHub repos are not easily discoverable so the chances of your question being found are rly slim. <br><br>
-> The only way to respond to questions as the one you posted would be to either **fork** the repo & edit it (like i did) or create a **pull request**, which seems troublesome for a simple discussion of Q&A's.

### I recommend using Reddit, a website with forums that help with multiple fields
#### Here are some subreddits that can help you with your task:
- [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/): a large and active community of beginners and experienced programmers alike. Here, you can ask questions about anything related to programming, from learning a new language to debugging your code.
- [r/Programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/): another large and active subreddit for programmers of all levels. Here, you can find news, discussions, and advice on all things programming.
- [r/codereview](https://www.reddit.com/r/codereview/): a subreddit where you can post your code for review by other programmers. This is a great way to get feedback on your code and improve your skills.
- [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer): a subreddit where you can find daily programming challenges. These challenges are a great way to practice your skills and learn new things.

These are just a few examples; [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) is packed with forums (subreddits) that can help you
